# Backend Architecture & Data Integrity Skill

## Purpose
This skill defines how backend systems remain correct, safe, and reliable
under real-world usage and failure conditions.

It ensures data accuracy, predictable behavior, and maintainable backend structure.

## Core Problems It Solves
- Invalid data entering the system
- Partial writes and broken records
- Unclear error handling
- Tight coupling between layers
- Hard-to-debug production issues

## Core Capabilities
- Request validation
- Transaction-safe operations
- Consistent error responses
- Clear service and repository separation
- Data integrity enforcement

## Why This Skill Matters
Most systems fail not because of missing features,
but because of **bad architecture and weak data handling**.
This skill prevents that.
