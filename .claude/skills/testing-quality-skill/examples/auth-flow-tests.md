# Authentication Flow Testing

## Tested Scenarios
- Successful signup
- Successful login
- Invalid credentials handling
- Session persistence
- Secure logout

## Validation Goals
- No unauthorized access
- Tokens expire correctly
- Sessions cleanly reset on logout
- Error messages are user-friendly

## Why It’s Critical
Authentication is a security boundary.
Any failure here breaks user trust instantly.
