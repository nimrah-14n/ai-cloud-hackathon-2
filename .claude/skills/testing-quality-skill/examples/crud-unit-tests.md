# CRUD Unit Testing Example

## Feature Scope
- Create Task
- Update Task
- Delete Task
- View Task
- Mark Task as Complete

## Test Objectives
- Ensure correct state updates
- Prevent invalid task creation
- Confirm deletion removes task permanently
- Validate completed task state
- Ensure UI reflects backend state accurately

## Expected Behavior
- Tasks appear instantly after creation
- Updates persist after refresh
- Deleted tasks never reappear
- Completed tasks are visually differentiated

## Professional Insight
CRUD without testing is fragile.
CRUD with testing becomes a reliable system component.
