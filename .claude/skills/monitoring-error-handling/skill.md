# Monitoring & Error Handling Skill

## Purpose
This skill provides a standardized way to handle errors across frontend, backend, and API layers.
It prevents application crashes, improves user trust, and ensures predictable system behavior.

## When to Use
- API integrations
- Authentication & authorization
- CRUD operations
- Network or database operations
- Deployment and demo preparation

## Core Responsibilities
- Capture and classify errors
- Prevent UI crashes using boundaries
- Standardize backend exceptions
- Return safe, meaningful error messages
- Improve debugging and observability

## Principles
- Fail gracefully, never silently
- Never expose internal errors to users
- Log technical details, show human-friendly messages
- Consistency across all layers

## Expected Outcome
A stable, professional application that behaves reliably under failure conditions and meets production-quality standards.
