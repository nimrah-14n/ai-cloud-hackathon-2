# Spec Driven Development Skill

## Purpose
This skill enforces **specification-first software development** across the entire system.
No frontend, backend, API, or UI logic is allowed to be implemented without a written,
validated, and approved specification.

This skill acts as the **governing intelligence** that controls all other skills.

---

## What This Skill Controls
- Feature behavior
- API contracts
- UI interactions
- Business rules
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Acceptance criteria

---

## Core Responsibilities
1. Convert vague requirements into executable specifications
2. Prevent implementation without specs
3. Align frontend & backend using shared contracts
4. Detect ambiguity before code is written
5. Provide Claude Code with strict execution boundaries

---

## Enforced Rules
- Every feature MUST have a spec
- Every spec MUST define acceptance criteria
- No assumption-based coding
- Specs override developer intuition
- Implementation must trace back to spec sections

---

## Output Guarantees
- Predictable behavior
- Reduced rework
- Judge-verifiable logic
- Market-grade documentation
- AI-safe execution paths

---

## Used By
- frontend-architecture
- backend-architecture
- api-management
- ui-components
- testing-quality

This skill is the **single source of truth**.
