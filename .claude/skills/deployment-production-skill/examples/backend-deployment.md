# Backend Deployment Example (FastAPI)

## Objective
Deploy backend services with stability and security.

## Key Checks
- API routes respond correctly
- Authentication middleware active
- Database connection secured
- Error handling enabled
- Logging configured

## Expected Behavior
- APIs respond within milliseconds
- Unauthorized access is blocked
- Database writes are consistent
- Errors do not crash the service

## Hackathon Focus
Only deploy what is demo-critical.
Stability > feature count.
