# Deployment & Production Readiness Skill

## Skill Level
Professional • Market-Ready • Hackathon II Phase II

## Purpose
This skill prepares the project for real-world usage by ensuring it can be deployed,
configured, monitored, and demonstrated reliably in a production-like environment.

## Why This Skill Matters
A project that only runs locally is incomplete.
Judges and employers value systems that can be deployed, scaled, and maintained.

## Core Responsibilities
- Production-ready environment setup
- Secure configuration management
- Backend & frontend deployment flow
- Database connectivity (Neon / SQL)
- Environment variable handling
- Build optimization
- Deployment failure recovery

## Hackathon Value
- Smooth demo without crashes
- Confidence during live judging
- Clear explanation of production readiness
- Shows industry-level engineering maturity
